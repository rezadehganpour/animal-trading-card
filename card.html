    The Japanese have three words to describe the essence of a Shiba. Kan-i refers to the breedâ€™s alertness and bravery; this awareness and confidence makes the Shiba a perfect watchdog. Ryosei means being good-natured, loyal, and obedient. Finally, soboku describes their easy, natural good looks.

    <p>Shiba Inus are the best dog for a small place. I got Simba when he was 2 weeks old and now he is 3 years old. He is very smart and super easy to train. they are super hyper so you need to put a time to take them outside and let them have fun.
